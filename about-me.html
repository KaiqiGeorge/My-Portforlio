           &nbsp;&nbsp;Hi my name is Kaiqi George from Guangzhou, China. I got my master degree in Hong Kong Polytechnic 
          university in 2016. I moved to the US in 2018 for work. I worked as a 5th and 6th grade teachers 
          in a Chinese immersion program teaching science, social studies and Chinese language arts. 
          <br /> <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;I took 
          a break from my career after I got married in May 2021. During this time, I found my passion in coding. I have been learning coding intensively for a year. 
          I love every minute of it. 
          
      </p>
      
        <p id="selfIntroductionParagraphTwo" class="col-6">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I got Responsible Web Design, JaveScript Algorithms and DataStructures, and Front End 
        Development Libraries Certifications from Freecodecamp.com. Every one of these certificate requires 300-hour learning 
        and four projects. 
        <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And now I am learning from SheCodes Coding workshops, and got two certificates named Introduction to Coding 
        and Front End Development.Each of these certificates requires 20-hour work every week and I lauched my very first app. 
         I am currenting learning the coing in another SheCodes workshop called SheCodes responsive. I am loving it!
